# Supervised Learning

This directory provides an overview and basic implementations of supervised learning algorithms — a core concept in machine learning used for predictive modeling.

## Overview

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where an algorithm learns from labeled training data to make predictions. The data consists of input-output pairs, where the model tries to learn the mapping function from inputs (features) to outputs (labels or targets).

Supervised learning can be categorized into:

- Classification – Predicting a discrete label (e.g., is population over 5 million, yes or no)
- Regression – Predicting a continuous value (e.g., population growth)

## Common Algorithms

- Linear Regression: Predicts continuous values using a linear relationship
- Logistic Regression: Classifies binary or multi-class outcomes
- Decision Trees: Tree-based models that split data into decision nodes
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Makes predictions based on the closest training examples
- Neural Networks: Learns complex mappings using layers of interconnected neurons
- Ensemble Methods: Combination of different algorithms

## Workflow

1. Data Collection: Gather labeled data (features + targets).
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean, normalize, or encode data.
3. Train-Test Split: Divide data into training and testing sets.
4. Model Training: Use training data to fit a model.
5. Evaluation: Assess performance using metrics like accuracy, MSE, precision, recall, etc.
6. Prediction: Apply the model to unseen data.
