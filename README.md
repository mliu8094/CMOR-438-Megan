# CMOR 438: Data Science and Machine Learning
Creator: Megan Liu

This repository contains the final project for CMOR 438, Data Science and Machine Learning, for the Spring 2025 semester at Rice University. The course is taught by Randy Davila and covers key supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms along with elements of reinforcement learning and optimization.

## Supervised and Unsupervised Learning
There are two main directories contained in this repository. The first is supervised machine learning, where the model is trained on a labeled dataset. Data values are associated with known labels and we want to build a predictive model on new,unseen inputs. The second is unsupervised machine learning, where the model is trained on unlabeled data. In this case, the algorithm tries to find patterns or structures in the data without any explicit guidance on what the output should be.

The required algorithms in each directory are as follows:
### Supervised Learning
1. The Perceptron
2. Linear Regression
3. Logistic Regression
4. Neural Networks
5. K Nearest Neighbors
6. Decision Trees / Regression Trees
7. Random Forests
8. Other Ensemble Methods, including Boosting

### Unsupervised Learning
1. K-Means Clustering
2. DBSCAN
3. Principal Component Analysis
4. Image Compression with the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

In this repository, I will be analyzing 2013 public transportation data from 17 countries across the world as well as 2019 socioeconomic data to gather insight on infrastructure, CO2 emissions, usage, efficiency, and socioeconomic indicators. This ultimately allows us to understand information important for governments, residents, or travelers in select countries from about 10 years ago. While it would be more optimal to have access to more recent data, this still provides trends regarding transit-dominant or car-dominant status, similar countries, or the relationship between certain socioeconomic features and transit use.
