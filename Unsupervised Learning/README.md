# Unsupervised Learning

This directory provides an introduction of unsupervised learning, a branch of machine learning used to uncover patterns or groupings in data without labeled outputs.

## Overview

Unsupervised learning models are trained on data without any explicit labels. The goal is to discover the underlying structure of the data, such as clusters, associations, or principal components.

Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning does not predict target values but provides information on the data's organization and distribution.

## Applications of Unsupervised Learning

- Clustering: Grouping similar data points (e.g., customer segmentation)
- Dimensionality Reduction: Reducing the number of features while preserving important structure (e.g., PCA for visualization)
- Anomaly Detection: Identifying data points that significantly deviate from the norm

## Some of the Algorithms Implemented in this Directory

- K-Means Clustering: Partitions data into $k$ groups by minimizing variance
- DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise): Groups data and identifies noise points
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Reduces dimensionality by projecting data onto principal axes
- Single Value Decomposition (SVD): Often used for image compression and file reduction

## Workflow

1. Data Collection: Gather raw, unlabeled data
2. Preprocessing: Scale, normalize, or transform data as needed
3. Model Training: Apply an unsupervised algorithm to detect patterns or structure
4. Evaluation: Use internal metrics (e.g., silhouette score, explained variance) to assess results
5. Interpretation: Analyze clusters or principal components
