# Linear Regression

This directory contains an implementation of the linear regression algorithm, a fundamental supervised learning technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In this project, linear regression is applied to a dataset that includes transportation data such as air transit passenger quantity and population in a country's largest city to predict greenhouse gas (primarily CO2) emissions.

## Overview

Linear regression aims to fit a straight line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) that best describes the relationship between the input features and the target variable. It minimizes the error between predicted and actual values using a method called least squares. The resulting model can be used to make continuous predictions, such as estimating emissions based on city characteristics.

### Linear Regression Pipeline

1. Initialize weights and bias to zero (or small random values).
2. For each training sample:
   - Use the formula Å· = mx + b to compute predictions.
   - Optimize weights (m in this case) and bias (b in this case) by minimizing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between predicted and actual values
3. Apply to test data
4. Evaluate performance using metrics:
   - RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): measures average prediction error
   - R^2 score: indicates the proportion of variance explained by the model
